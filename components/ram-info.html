            <p>Random Access Memory (RAM) is a critical component in a computer, responsible for storing data
                temporarily while the computer is running. It allows your system to access data quickly, which is
                essential for multitasking and running applications smoothly.</p>

            <h3>Main Functions of RAM</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stores data that is actively being used by the CPU.</li>
                <li>Allows for fast access to information needed for running applications and processes.</li>
                <li>Improves overall system performance and responsiveness.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Features to Consider</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> More RAM allows for better multitasking and handling of large
                    applications (e.g., 8GB, 16GB, 32GB).</li>
                <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Faster RAM can improve performance, especially in tasks like gaming and
                    video editing (e.g., 2400MHz, 3200MHz).</li>
                <li><strong>Latency:</strong> Lower latency can improve responsiveness, typically measured in CAS
                    (Column Address Strobe) latency.</li>
                <li><strong>Form Factor:</strong> Ensure compatibility with your motherboard (e.g., DIMM for desktops,
                    SO-DIMM for laptops).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Types of RAM: DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5</h3>
            <p>RAM has evolved over the years, with DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5 being the most common types found in modern
                computers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>DDR3:</strong> An older generation of RAM, still used in some systems. It offers lower
                    speeds and higher power consumption compared to newer types.</li>
                <li><strong>DDR4:</strong> The most widely used type of RAM in current systems. It provides a good
                    balance of speed, capacity, and power efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>DDR5:</strong> The latest generation of RAM, offering higher speeds, greater capacity, and
                    better power efficiency. It is ideal for high-performance tasks and future-proofing your system.
                </li>
            </ul>
