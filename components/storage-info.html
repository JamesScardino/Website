            <p>Storage devices are essential components for storing and retrieving data on a computer. There are three main types of storage used in modern computers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hard Disk Drives (HDD):</strong> These drives use spinning disks to read and write data. They offer large storage capacities at a lower cost per gigabyte but are generally slower than SSDs.</li>
                <li><strong>Solid State Drives (SSD):</strong> These drives use flash memory to store data, resulting in much faster read and write speeds compared to HDDs. They are more expensive per gigabyte but significantly improve system performance.</li>
                <li><strong>NVMe Drives:</strong> Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) drives connect directly to the motherboard via the PCIe interface, offering even faster data transfer speeds than traditional SSDs. They are ideal for high-performance computing tasks and applications that require rapid access to data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Choosing the right storage type depends on your needs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HDDs:</strong> Ideal for bulk storage of large files such as videos, photos, and backups due to their larger capacities and lower cost.</li>
                <li><strong>SSDs:</strong> Perfect for installing operating systems and frequently used applications, as well as improving overall system responsiveness and boot times.</li>
                <li><strong>NVMe Drives:</strong> Best for users who need the fastest possible data access speeds for demanding tasks such as video editing, gaming, and running large databases.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Many modern computers use a combination of HDDs, SSDs, and NVMe drives to take advantage of the strengths of each type.</p>
